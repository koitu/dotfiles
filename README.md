## Installation

This dotfiles are managed by using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/">GNU stow</a> so be sure to install it.

---

**Important:** stow cannot create a symlink if the config files already exist. Be sure to delete the default configs before attempting install.

---

Stow will by default create symlinks to the parent of your current directory.

These commands should be excuted in `~/dotfiles` and assume you have cloned this repo to that location.

Another option is to use `-d` with the repo location.

To install my i3 config simply execute:

```
stow i3
```

This will symlink the files to `~/.config/i3`

---

When installing elsewhere use `-t` to specify the location.

To install systemwide configs (/etc configs):

```
sudo stow -t / pacman
```

To install for root user:

```
sudo stow termite -t /root
```

To uninstall use the `-D` argument:

```
stow -D i3
```
## Screenshots

Coming soon

## General configs

### pacman
change you can do:
you can use ccache to improve build times by caching the result of compilations for successive use.
In makepkg.conf the line `PKGEXT='.pkg.tar' makepkg` will allow you skip compression but you will have larger packages
### i3
install xdotool xbanish

### Zathura

```
sudo pacman -S zathura zathura-cb zathura-djvu zathura-pdf-mupdf zathura-ps
```

## My Laptop

**note: avoid using symlinks for /etc configs**
---

```
sudo pacman -S logid
sudo systemctl enable logid
```
Restart laptop

---

### Multihead and Nvidia

https://github.com/rliou92/python-umonitor
